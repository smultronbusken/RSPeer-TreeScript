# RSPeer-TreeScript

RuneMate had a really nice bot based on a binary search tree so I made one for RSPeer. 

## Quick Walkthrough

Each node in the BST is a task. The script traverses the tree depending on the validation of each task. Implement ```onCreateRootNode()``` to specify the root of the tree. Check out [this thread](https://www.runemate.com/community/threads/why-you-should-switch-to-a-treebot.9100/) on the RuneMate forums for more info. This script function almost 100% the same as that one.
